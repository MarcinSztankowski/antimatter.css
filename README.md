# Antimatter.css

##You can't create flexbox grid that will be less than 1kb
###Hold my beer

Antimatter is fully functional responsive flexbox grid and its only **877 bytes** mimified and gzipped!
Compatible with: IE 11, Firefox 37+, Chrome 42+, Opera 29+, IE Mobile 11, Android Chrome 42+ and Android Firefix 37+!

The fundamental difference between Antimatter.css and other frameworks is that you use attributes instead of classes to define columns.
